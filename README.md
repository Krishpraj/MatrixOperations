# Matrix Operations Project

This project demonstrates various matrix operations including **transpose**, **row-reduced echelon form (RREF)**, and others using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as an interactive tool to perform these operations, which I learned in my Linear Algebra course. The app allows users to input matrices, and it will compute and display results for the selected operations.

## Features

- **Matrix Input**: Allows users to input matrices of any size.
- **Matrix Transpose**: Computes and displays the transpose of the input matrix.
- **Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)**: Computes the RREF of the matrix.
- **Other Matrix Operations**: Includes additional operations such as determinant, inverse, etc. (add more as necessary).
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be responsive for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the webpage and input forms for matrices.
- **CSS**: Styles the webpage and ensures a clean, user-friendly layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the matrix operations, such as transpose, RREF, and other calculations. It also handles the logic for user inputs and result display.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishpraj/matrix-operations.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd matrix-operations
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to start using the tool.

4. Input the matrix dimensions and values, then select the operation you wish to perform (e.g., transpose, RREF).

5. The result will be displayed below the input matrix.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this project! Suggestions, bug fixes, and feature improvements are welcome.
